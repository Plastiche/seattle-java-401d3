Copy/Paste => Rename
- Manually rename variables, move things around.  
- See how the parts fit together, even if you don't understand them individually _yet_.

Break the problem down into general chunks.
- How to get to A => Z.  Split things into big chunks, then those into smaller chunks.
- Use previous experience, references, for how to do each chunk of the problem.
- Repeat until you have an approach.
